Hi there 👋
I'm Ashwini More, a Data Scientist and Machine Learning enthusiast with a Master’s Degree in Data Analytics from Northeastern University, specializing in AI/ML. My journey in the world of data began with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from Pune University, and over the past few years, I’ve been fortunate to work across various domains like marketing, disaster response, and product bundling.

In my recent role as a Data Science Intern at Feastech Data Corp, I contributed to optimizing disaster response by working on large-scale language models(LLMs), utilizing NLP techniques to prepare and integrate data for improved decision-making. This helped streamline processes and enhance user engagement. My work also involved organizing and optimizing data pipelines for faster and more efficient data retrieval, helping to make actionable insights more accessible.

Before that, I worked as a Data Scientist at WE33RAS Pvt Ltd., where I focused on improving digital marketing performance and customer behavior analysis. I led initiatives that enhanced marketing efficiency, optimized budget allocation, and boosted overall campaign performance. I also developed predictive models that provided valuable insights, driving data-driven decisions in SEM campaigns.

I am passionate about applying machine learning techniques to solve business problems, especially through predictive modeling, NLP, and data visualization. My work in predictive market analysis, customer behavior modeling, and building AI solutions has allowed me to make a tangible impact, whether it’s improving SEM performance or predicting cross-selling opportunities.

When I'm not diving into data, I enjoy exploring new AI technologies and contributing to innovative projects that push the boundaries of machine learning. Feel free to check out my projects and collaborations!


👀 I’m interested in ...
Generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). I’m fascinated by how these technologies are transforming the way we interact with data, especially in creating smarter, more efficient solutions to complex business problems. From LLM-powered chatbots to RAG-enhanced systems, I'm always excited to explore their potential in real-world applications.

🌱 I’m currently learning ...
I’m working on a project called Generative AI-Powered SWOT Analysis Generator, where I’m developing a system that automatically generates SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analyses for companies by leveraging real-time data retrieval, LLMs, and RAG. It’s an exciting challenge that’s allowing me to dive deeper into the intersection of AI and business strategy.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
Projects that focus on AI, data-driven decision-making, and machine learning solutions. I’m always excited to connect with like-minded professionals who share a passion for leveraging AI to solve real-world problems.
