Hi there 👋 I’m Ashwini More, a Data Scientist with a passion for machine learning and AI. I hold a Master’s in Data Analytics from Northeastern University, specializing in AI/ML, and a Bachelor's in Computer Science from Pune University.

In my recent role as a Data Science Intern at Feastech Data Corp, I contributed to optimizing disaster response by working on large-scale language models(LLMs), utilizing NLP techniques to prepare and integrate data for improved decision-making. This helped streamline processes and enhance user engagement.  Before that, I worked as a Data Scientist at WE33RAS Pvt Ltd., where I focused on improving digital marketing performance and customer behavior analysis. I led initiatives that enhanced marketing efficiency, optimized budget allocation, and boosted overall campaign performance. I also developed predictive models that provided valuable insights, driving data-driven decisions in SEM campaigns.

I’m always excited to explore new AI technologies and work on projects that push the boundaries of machine learning.

👀 I’m interested in ...
Generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). I’m fascinated by how these technologies are transforming the way we interact with data, especially in creating smarter, more efficient solutions to complex business problems. From LLM-powered chatbots to RAG-enhanced systems, I'm always excited to explore their potential in real-world applications.

🌱 I’m currently learning ...
I’m working on a project called Generative AI-Powered SWOT Analysis Generator, where I’m developing a system that automatically generates SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analyses for companies by leveraging real-time data retrieval, LLMs, and RAG. It’s an exciting challenge that’s allowing me to dive deeper into the intersection of AI and business strategy.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
Projects that focus on AI, data-driven decision-making, and machine learning solutions. I’m always excited to connect with like-minded professionals who share a passion for leveraging AI to solve real-world problems.
